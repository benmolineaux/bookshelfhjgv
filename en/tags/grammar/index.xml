The last and most complete of the missionary grammars of Mapudungun is that of the Bavarian Felix José de Augusta. Born in the city of Augsburg in 1860 as August Stephan Kathan, he studied medicine in Würzburg and then in Munich, where he obtained his doctorate. In 1887 he was accepted into the Capuchin order in Laufen, taking the name of Felix Joseph which was followed up by the name of his place of origin: von Augsburg.</description>

      <description>Transcribed
This is a brief grammar and Spanish-Mapudungun vocabulary focusing on the dialect of the pampas, east of the Andes (Puelmapu), written by Liutenant Colonel Carlos Federico Barbará, of the Argentinian army. The grammatical content follows Febrés (1765) quite closely.
A version of the Vocabulary can be found at the following website: https://pueblosoriginarios.com/lenguas/pampa.php UN-Tagged Text (Web) PDF Text (Image Scans) </description>

      <title>Bernhard Havestadt: Chilidúģu</title>

Fr. Bernhard Havestadt (1714-1778), a German Jesuit, was the author of one of the two 18th century grammars of Mapudungun. A native of Köln, he left the Westphalia monastery of Horst-Maria for the ‘Indies’ in 1746, taking up his post in the region of La Frontera in March of 1748. Here he remained for twenty-two years, leaving a lively record of his evangelisation work and travels.
His grammar,though apparently available in a Spanish-language manuscript in the mid-1750’s, was published &amp;mdash; in Latin &amp;mdash; only in 1777 as Chilidúģu: Sive Tractatus Linguæ Chilensis.</description>

      <title>Andrés Febres: Arte de la Lengua General del Reyno de Chile</title>
      <link>https://benmolineaux.github.io/bookshelf/en/core-texts/febres/</link>

This was the most widely used early work on Mapudungun. So much so that the HMS Beagle, in its famous travels with Captiain Fitz Roy and young Charles Darwin, carried a copy of it in 1831-6.
Its author was the Catalan Jesuit Andrés Febrés (1732-1790), who arrived to the Mapuche-speaking territories in 1759 at the age of 27. He appears to have learnt the language and written his grammar less than five years after his arrival in Chile.</description>

      <title>Luis de Valdivia: Arte y Gramática</title>

This is the oldest textual source explicitly focusing on Mapudungun. Its author is Father Luis de Valdivia, a Spanish priest who was one of the original members of the Chilean Mission of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), founded in 1593.
Throughout his stay in the country, Valdivia was actively involved not only in the education of the colonists and evangelisation of the Mapuche, but also in early attempts to prevent military confrontations between the two groups.</description>
