This is a vocabulary of some 515 words and phrases compiled by Dutch explorers and military men on a reconnaissance mission to Chile from their territories in Brazil. The expedition set out in January 1643 with Hendrik Brouwer as its admiral. The vice-admiral was one Elias Herckmans, Governor of Parahyba, who, upon Brouwer&amp;rsquo;s death in August 1643, took over the entire expedition. As the most senior officer on the expedition and chief negotiator with the local population, the vocabulary is attributed to him.</description>

      <title>Luis de Valdivia: Sermon en Lengua de Chile</title>
      <link>https://benmolineaux.github.io/bookshelf/en/core-texts/valdiviasermones/</link>

      <description>Transcribed
This set of early seventeenth-century sermons was composed by Fr. Luis de Valdiva (1560–1621) , one of the first Spanish Jesuits assigned to Chile. Valdivia played a cruical role in the development of Spanish Crown&amp;rsquo;s &amp;lsquo;defensive war&amp;rsquo; policy towards the Mapuche, which suspended direct attacks on native groups and emphasised acculturation.
The sermons are intended as a programatic introduction to Christian faith, with the express intent of converting the Mapuche and having them renounce their traditional beliefs and religious practices.</description>

      <description>Partially Transcribed
This is the oldest textual source explicitly focusing on Mapudungun. Its author is Father Luis de Valdivia, a Spanish priest who was one of the original members of the Chilean Mission of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits), founded in 1593.
Throughout his stay in the country, Valdivia was actively involved not only in the education of the colonists and evangelisation of the Mapuche, but also in early attempts to prevent military confrontations between the two groups.</description>
