      <description>Subtitle: (La Faz Social)
Transcribed
Manuel Manquilef (1882&amp;ndash;1950) was a Mapuche teacher, author and intellectual from the turn of the 20th century. Born in the province of Cautín, he attended the main highschool in Temuco, where he met Tomás de Guevara, who he collaborated with on his principal ethnographic works on the Mapuche. Indeed, it is possible that Guevara took much of Manquilef&amp;rsquo;s work and published it under his own name.</description>

      <title>Tomás Guevara: Folklore Araucano</title>

      <description>Transcribed
At the time of publication (1911), Tomás de Guevara was head teacher at Temuco&amp;rsquo;s main secondary school (Liceo de Temuco). He had long had an interest in Mapuche folklore and ethnography, as many of his students came from the fairly new reservations (reducciones) established in the late 19th century. As with his later texts, much of the compilation and translation of material was actually the work of his collaborator, Manuel Manquilef, a native speaker of Mapudungun and one of the first Mapuche teachers at the school.</description>

      <title>Rodolfo Lenz: Estudios Araucanos</title>

      <description>NOT Transcribed
A collection of late-19th-century texts compiled by the German-born linguist Dr. Rudlof Lenz in different regions of Chile. These constitute some of the first real samples of authentic Mapuche speech, as earlier texts were mostly religious prose translated into Mapudungun by Jesuit missionaries. Lenz&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Estudios&amp;rdquo; are also important as they survey a number of different dialects and provide early, fairly-detailed phonetic transcriptions, using state-of-the-art notation techniques for the period.</description>
